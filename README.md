### Hey, I'm Kyle!


My name is [Kyle Bess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle9bess/) and I'm a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. My main interests consist of trying to better understand the intricacies and minutia of software security and architecture. I'm mainly a Python and Go Dev, but can't wait to touch more techs. Welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to check out my projects and medium articles.
#### Projects on the Horizon:
	1. Monkeytype.com-esque CLI tool because I'm a keyboard nerd
	2. Pomodoro timer to start dialing in my attention for Grad School
	3. Finishing out Push Button Poet (Read the README)
	4. Writing some super simple Malware to get a feel for it
	5. Django/Python website for riders to get gear inches, maybe a forum
⚡ Hobbies: Fixed Gear Bikes, Watches, Guitars, and Mechanical Keyboards.

Please don't bully me on contributions. Everything is done in private repos for school because they care about things like plagirism.
