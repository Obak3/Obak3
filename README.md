### Hey, I'm Kyle!


My name is [Kyle Bess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle9bess/) and I'm a Software Engineer at Adobe, but also limping along a master's at UPenn. My main interests consist of trying to better understand the intricacies and minutia of software security and architecture. I'm mainly a Python and Go Dev, but can't wait to dive deeper into more technologies. Welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to check out my projects and medium articles.
#### Projects on the Horizon:
	1. LeetCode Pomodoro timer w/ Markdown Entrys (GO)
	2. 'Open Source' Master's degree. My Master's, but for free.... (Python, Java, and C)
	3. Monkeytype.com-esque CLI tool because I'm a keyboard nerd (RUST)

âš¡ Hobbies: Gravel Bikes, Watches, Guitars, and Mechanical Keyboards.
