### Hey, I'm Kyle!


My name is [Kyle Bess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle9bess/) and I'm a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. My main interests consist of trying to better understand the intricacies and minutia of software security and architecture. I'm mainly a Python and Go Dev, but can't wait to touch more techs. Welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to check out my projects and medium articles.
