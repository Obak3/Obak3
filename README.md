### Hey, I'm Kyle!

<!--
**Obak3/Obak3** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania that is focusing on diversifying the tech stacks that I can work in to better diversify my abilities. I love cybersecurity and have worked as an analyst before, but I plan on competing in several hackathons and Capture the Flag events to further build on my interests.    

To Do:    
1. Add Technologies I work in.  
2. Add picture of Penn for a background.   
3. Add some sIcK GiFs.
