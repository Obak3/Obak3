### Hey, I'm Kyle!


My name is [Kyle Bess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle9bess/) and I'm a Software Engineer at Adobe, but also limping along a master's at UPenn. My main interests consist of trying to better understand the intricacies and minutia of software security and architecture. I'm mainly a Python and Go Dev, but can't wait to dive deeper into more technologies. Welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to check out my projects and medium articles.
#### Projects on the Horizon:
	1. Recursive search from a parent dir to match on two substrings within a certain number of lines (rust)
	1. Building a 'toy' language 'Moon' with LLVM to try to get a better feel for compilers
	2. Finishing out the stuff that I already have going on. 

âš¡ Hobbies: Gravel Bikes, Watches, Guitars, and Mechanical Keyboards.
