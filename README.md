### Hey, I'm Kyle!


My name is [Kyle Bess](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle9bess/) and I'm a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. My main interests consist of trying to better understand the intricacies and minutia of software security and architecture. I'm mainly a Python and Go Dev, but can't wait to touch more techs. Welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to check out my projects and medium articles.
#### Projects on the Horizon:
	1. LeetCode Pomodoro timer w/ Markdown Entry for taking notes on problems
	2. 'Open Source' Master's degree. My Master's, but for free....
	3. Monkeytype.com-esque CLI tool because I'm a keyboard nerd
	4. Pomodoro timer to start dialing in my attention for Grad School

⚡ Hobbies: Fixed Gear Bikes, Watches, Guitars, and Mechanical Keyboards.

Please don't bully me on contributions. Everything is done in private repos for school because they care about things like plagirism.
